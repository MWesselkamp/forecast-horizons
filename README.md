# Revisiting the ecological forecast horizon.

The code that accompanies our work on actual, relative and potential system predictability. The pre-print is available on arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00753. We are happy about a citation if you use the code.
The four case studies revisit empirical forecast horizons are:

1. Stochastic Ricker equation (s_ricker) (based on May 1976)
2. Coupled extended Ricker equation (c_ricker) (based on May 1976)
3. ML-based land surface emulator (land_emulation) (Wesselkamp et al. 2024)
4. Individual-based forest ecosystem model (iLand) (Seidl et al. 2012)

## Data for reproducability

- Experiments 1. and 2. work with simulations which are generated in code.
- Experiment 3 works with a data base that is published with DOI 10.21957/pcf3-ah06.
- Experiment 4 runs with data, available in the iLand/data folder.
